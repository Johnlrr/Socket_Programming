This is my university's project about Socket Programming.

--- There is two part of this project ---

I. Part 1

This part contains 2 file: server.cpp, client.cpp
- Run server.cpp first, then run client.cpp, then client enter their name
- Client pick files want to download from the list that shown on the console, and write them in input.txt
- Client then back to console and enter any character to start downloading process.
- Client must wait for the downloading process finish to continue request files.


II. Part 2

This part contains server2.cpp, client2.cpp
- Run server2.cpp first, then run client2.cpp, then client enter their name
- Client pick files want to download from the list that shown on the console, and write them in input.txt
- The programm will automatically scan and downloading
- Client can request file to download even the program is in downloading process.
